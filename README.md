# AFINN demo

A demo of sentiment analysis using AFINN.
Purposefully written in multiple languages,
to demonstrate the differences between
R (i.e. TidyVerse) and
Python (i.e. Pandas and company)
for projects like this.

Will return to this... eventually.
Just committing and publishing what I have for now.
